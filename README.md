This project combines different graphs [create by CampusX](https://github.com/campusx-official) for DSMP Course to teach some mathematics and statistics topics. I use their individual repo and combine to one Streamlit App which contains additional intuition regrading graphs or their topics.

## Graphs

1. [confidence-interval-viz](https://github.com/campusx-official/confidence-interval-viz): Confidence Interval Simulation
2. [z-distribution-confidence-interval](https://github.com/campusx-official/z-distribution-confidence-interval): Confidence Interval Calculator
3. [normal-distribution-vs-t-distribution](https://github.com/campusx-official/normal-distribution-vs-t-distribution): Normal and t-Distribution Comparison
4. [matrix-linear-transformation-viz](https://github.com/campusx-official/matrix-linear-transformation-viz): Matrix-Based Linear Transformation
   - This repository contains many Python scripts which has different graphs each.

## Added Features

Some feature or contents added by me which are not present originally.

- Add Title and Description of the graph.
- Add URL of the video in which the graph being used.
