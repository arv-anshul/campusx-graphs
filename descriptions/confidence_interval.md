## Definition

**Confidence interval**, _in simple words,_ is a range of values within which we expect a particular
population parameter, like a mean, to fall. It's a way to express the uncertainty around an
estimate obtained from a sample of data.

**Confidence level**, usually expressed as a percentage like 95%, indicates how sure we are that
the true value lies within the interval.

$$ \text{Confidence Interval} = \text{Point Estimate} \pm \text{Margin of Error} $$

## Interpreting Confidence Interval

A **confidence interval** is a _range of values within which a population parameter_, such as the population mean, is estimated to lie with a certain level of confidence. The confidence interval provides an indication of the precision and uncertainty associated with the estimate. To interpret the confidence interval values, consider the following points:

- **Confidence level:** The confidence level (commonly set at 90%, 95%, or 99%) represents the probability that the confidence interval will contain the true population parameter if the sampling and estimation process were repeated multiple times. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that if you were to draw 100 different samples from the population and calculate the confidence interval for each, approximately 95 of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.

- **Interval range:** The width of the confidence interval gives an indication of the precision of the estimate. A narrower confidence interval suggests a more precise estimate of the population parameter, while a wider interval indicates greater uncertainty. The width of the interval depends on the sample size, variability in the data, and the desired level of confidence.

- **Interpretation:** To interpret the confidence interval values, you can say that you are "X% confident that the true population parameter lies within the range (lower limit, upper limit)." Keep in mind that this statement is about the interval, not the specific point estimate, and it refers to the confidence level you chose when constructing the interval.
